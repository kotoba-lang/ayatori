# ayatori

`ayatori.disclosure/recipient-decryptor-async` connects recipient-bound key
delivery to `remote/open-snapshot-async`'s existing `:decrypt-fn`:

```clojure
(require '[ayatori.disclosure :as disclosure])

(def decrypt
  (disclosure/recipient-decryptor-async
   {:context! trusted-context-for-ciphertext-cid
    :request! sign-request-for-exact-grant
    :deliver! call-key-delivery-service
    :verify! verify-executor-signature-with-trusted-registry
    :open! qualified-hybrid-unwrap-and-content-decrypt
    :crypto-policy production-hybrid-policy}))
;; Pass decrypt as :decrypt-fn to remote/open-snapshot-async below.
```

These are host ports, not built-in credentials or a deployed key endpoint.
Each encrypted value is hashed to its raw CID; a signed delivery receipt must
bind that CID, request, recipient encryption key, grant, policy and epoch before
`open!` can run. Local time/epoch is refreshed after delivery. Ciphertext memo
hits do not cache authority. `recipient-decryptor` is the synchronous equivalent
and refuses Promise ports. Existing query visibility and governed execution
remain required; this adapter does not add permissions to a query.

The wire contract and provider obligations live in
[`kotobase/docs/disclosure-grants.edn`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase/blob/main/docs/disclosure-grants.edn).
The key envelope must stay behind the service until its delivery event is
durable. Publishing it in advance defeats delivery auditing. Recipient-specific
grant CIDs identify distribution paths, not different identities for identical
decrypted bytes. Scope is an exact ciphertext object in this first profile.

### `ayatori.disclosure-open` — the `:open!` port, with a real key in it

`:open!` is the one place where a real secret key touches a real ciphertext,
so `ayatori.disclosure` leaves it to the host. What was missing was not the
port but anything to put in it: every test until now handed it a closure that
already held the content key, which proves the delivery protocol and proves
nothing about the delivery of a key.

```clojure
(require '[ayatori.disclosure-open :as open])

(def opener
  (open/recipient-opener
   {:keys!         resolve-my-secret-keys-for-this-fingerprint
    :open-content! decrypt-the-object-under-its-content-key}))
```

It still owns no keys and no ciphertext framing — both stay ports, because
where a recipient's X25519 and ML-KEM secret keys live is a deployment
decision and how the object is framed under its content key travels with the
ciphertext. What it owns is the step between them: the wrapped key arrives as
the octet vector `:sealed/ciphertext`, is opened by
[`kotoba-lang/envelope`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/envelope)'s
hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM-768 provider with `binding(grant)` as the
authenticated context, and the recovered key reaches `:open-content!` and
nothing else — never returned, never logged, overwritten once the content is
out.

`:keys!` must return a map whose `:recipient-key` is the fingerprint it was
asked for. A custody store that hands back a different key is refused there,
by name, rather than four steps later as an AEAD failure indistinguishable
from forgery. An absent or empty `binding` is refused rather than used: that
is not a weaker binding but none, and the wrap would open under any grant
producing the same envelope.

The provider under this port is qualified — `envelope.qualify` runs the
deployed ML-KEM module against known answers BouncyCastle generated and hands
the evidence to `kotoba.security.crypto-policy/evaluate-pq-provider`. Key
custody is not: `:keys!` is where that gap lives, and it is a port precisely
so it is visible.

**The query plane woven from IPLD graphs and IPNI provider discovery.**

See the accepted [IPLD retrieval contract](docs/ipld-retrieval-contract.md) for
Selector hydration, CAR interoperability limits, and implementation gates.

Ayatori bridges [`kotobase`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase)'s flat document
store to real cross-record Datalog queries via
[`arrangement`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/arrangement) — built as a shared
prerequisite (ADR-2607172300 in `com-junkawasaki/root`) for four sibling repos
(`datomic-client-shim`, `org-postgresql-wire`, `org-opencypher-cypher`,
`org-w3-sparql-protocol`) that each need real queries over kotobase-backed
data and should not each reimplement this bridge.

The name reflects the boundary: IPLD owns immutable values, links, traversal,
and verification; IPNI tells Ayatori where a CID may be available; CARv2 says
where inside an object a block's bytes begin; Ayatori weaves those inputs into
a queryable projection. These are separate effects: an IPNI provider result is
not proof that content was retrieved or CID-verified, a CARv2 index entry is
not proof that the frame it points at hashes to the CID it claims, and none of
them is proof that a query was evaluated.

Current implemented surfaces:

- `ayatori.discovery` — injected-transport IPNI/Delegated Routing provider lookup;
- `ayatori.remote` — verified provider block reads and range-pruned queries over
  persistent arrangement snapshots;
- `ayatori.query` — materialization, visibility-carrying access paths, and Datalog;
- `ayatori.agent` — pure query generation and validation helpers.

`kotobase.query.bridge` and `kotobase.query.agent` remain compatibility
namespaces. New callers should use `ayatori.*`.

## `ayatori.remote` — IPNI → verified IPLD → persistent query

`ayatori.remote/open-snapshot` connects the distributed read path without
turning any one step into evidence for the next one:

```clojure
(require '[ayatori.remote :as remote])

(def opened
  (remote/open-snapshot
   {:snapshot-cid arrangement-snapshot-cid
    ;; Or inject :discover-fn directly. http-fn is the IPNI JSON transport.
    :http-fn ipni-http
    ;; Turns advertised HTTPS multiaddrs into trustless-gateway block GETs.
    ;; A custom (fn [provider cid] -> bytes) may be injected instead.
    :fetch-fn (remote/gateway-fetcher block-http)
    :blind-fn blind
    :decrypt-fn decrypt
    ;; The same declared range partitions used by arrangement.core/commit!.
    :partitions [{:attr "score"
                  :boundaries [25 50 75]
                  :budget-bits 2}]}))

(remote/q opened
          '{:find [?entity ?score]
            :where [[?entity "score" ?score]
                    [(>= ?score 25)]
                    [(< ?score 50)]]}
          visible?)

(remote/stats opened)
;; {:discoveries ... :fetch-attempts ... :verified-blocks ...
;;  :verified-bytes ... :memo-hits ... :in-flight-hits ...}
```

The snapshot and every Prolly-tree block are rehashed before use. A bad or
missing provider is skipped, but unverified bytes are never returned or
memoised. `arrangement.source/cursor` then reads only the covering-index
prefixes named by the Datalog clauses. A declared range additionally uses the
persistent range tree and reports whether the read was actually pruned, plus
the declared disclosure budget, through `remote/scan-range-report`.

The synchronous API remains available for JVM services. Workers use the
explicit Promise surface: `open-snapshot-async`, `q-async`, `scan-async`, and
`scan-range-report-async`. Its discovery, provider GET, snapshot opening,
blinding, decryption, and prolly-tree descent all remain async; tree children
are fetched with bounded concurrency instead of a synchronous block-miss
trampoline that retries from the root. `q-async` carries the full Datalog
surface—joins, safe negation, disjunction, recursive rules, aggregates,
persisted range cuts, ordering, and limits—across that cursor without
materializing the snapshot. Promise propagation stays explicit; `remote/q`
remains synchronous.

Concurrent scans often descend through the same upper tree blocks. The async
getter therefore shares one in-flight Promise per CID: callers await the same
verified retrieval, failed flights are removed before retry, and only resolved
verified bytes enter the memo. `:in-flight-hits` makes that coalescing visible.

CID verification now preserves the codec declared by the requested CID and
checks its SHA-256 multihash. Persistent Arrangement snapshots remain
DAG-CBOR, while the transport/verification seam can also validate real raw or
DAG-PB provider responses before a higher layer decides how to decode them.

## `ayatori.pack` — CARv2 packs, and why the layout has to be declared

`ayatori.remote` fetches one block per request. That is correct, and it is one
network round trip per block. The novelty chain it hydrates is a cons chain of
width 1 (ADR-2608021000), so those round trips are strictly sequential and
cannot be prefetched away — the cost is structural, not a tuning problem.

A CARv2 pack removes the network's half of it. Blocks written together live in
one archive, so one HTTP `Range` read serves a block that would otherwise have
been its own request. The chain stays logically sequential; only the transport
stops being.

```clojure
(require '[ayatori.pack :as pack] '[ayatori.remote :as remote])

(def p (pack/open-pack {:range-fn my-range-reader          ; (fn [{:keys [range]}] -> bytes)
                        :profile  {:blocks :packed-blocks
                                   :object #{:range-read}}}))

(def getter (remote/provider-block-getter
             {:discover-fn my-discover-fn
              :fetch-fn    (pack/pack-fetcher p)}))        ; drop-in fetch-fn
```

`pack-fetcher` has the same shape as the per-object fetcher, so the verified
getter's CID rehash, provider fallback and memo are unchanged.

Better still, pass it as `:block-source`, which is tried **before** discovery:

```clojure
(remote/open-snapshot
 {:snapshot-cid  cid
  :discover-fn   my-discover-fn                 ; still there, for the fallback
  :fetch-fn      my-fetch-fn
  :block-source  #(pack/read-block p %)         ; no IPNI lookup when it answers
  :blind-fn      blind :decrypt-fn decrypt})
```

Measured: a getter reading 6 blocks costs 6 discoveries through `:fetch-fn`
and **0** through `:block-source`. A source that returns nil falls through to
discovery; one that returns the wrong bytes is refused by the same CID rehash
a provider's bytes get, skipped rather than made fatal, and counted as
`:source-failures` so a corrupt pack is visible rather than merely slow.

⚠ `:block-source` is threaded through the **synchronous** getter only. A
Worker on `open-snapshot-async` still pays discovery per block behind a pack.

### There is no default block layout, and `:packed-blocks` needs `:range-read`

Per ADR-2608160100, a backend declares one of:

| layout | meaning |
|---|---|
| `:block-per-object` | one CID, one object — the existing path |
| `:packed-blocks` | many CIDs inside one object, addressed by range |

`:packed-blocks` is **refused** unless the object plane also declares
`:range-read`, and that refusal is the point of this namespace rather than a
detail of it. Without `Range`, a packed reader still returns *correct bytes* —
it GETs the whole archive and picks one frame out of it. Round trips go down.
Every assertion about correctness passes. Only transfer explodes. It is a
success that reads as a success, so nothing downstream can catch it; it has to
be refused at the only place that knows both halves. The profile is checked
before any request is issued.

### Measured against the per-object path

`bench/fitness.cljs` answers the same query over the same snapshot through both
paths and refuses (exit 2) if they ever disagree on the answer, so a cheaper arm
cannot win by returning less. Counts, never wall clock — ADR-2608160100 sets the
metric as round trips, and this repo is developed on a machine running many
agents at once.

At 800 subjects / 1600 quads / 23 blocks, answer fixed at 3 rows:

| path | round trips | bytes |
|---|---|---|
| per-object (discover + fetch per block) | 12 | 109,764 |
| packed, 64 KiB read-ahead | 8 | **394,217** |
| packed, exact frame range | **8** | **110,996** |

The middle row is why `bounded-index` exists. `ipld.car.v2/locate` returns
only `:file-offset`, because the CARv2 index stores where a frame starts and
not how long it is — so a reader either over-fetches or reads to the next
record. Over-fetching *reduced round trips and tripled transfer*: a win on the
metric the ADR names and a loss on the one that scales. Reading to the next
record needs no extra fetch (the records are sorted, and the header gives the
payload end), and the derived lengths are asserted equal to the ones `pack`
itself computed.

Net: **1.50× fewer round trips at parity transfer** — the +1.1% is the header
and index reads, which are bounded rather than proportional.

Across a 16× database sweep with the answer size held at 3 rows, per-object
round trips grew 2.00×, so the persistent path is not O(database); it follows
the index ranges the query names.

The full loop that produced this — including the hypothesis the measurement
refuted — is `bench/coscientist-iteration-01.edn`.

### Costs, in round trips

Round trips rather than wall clock: this repo is developed on a machine
running many agents at once, so a timing figure describes the machine.

| | range reads |
|---|---|
| open a pack | 2 — header, then index — regardless of block count |
| read N blocks | N |
| block not in the pack | 0, and `nil` rather than a throw, so the caller can fall back to the per-object path |
| re-read through the getter | 0 (the getter's memo) |

A pack with no index is refused: without one, locating a block means reading
the whole payload, which is the cost this exists to avoid.

The CARv2 codec itself is `kotoba-lang/io-ipld-car`. This namespace reads packs
and never writes them — a second encoder is how the `:file-offset` versus
`:payload-offset` convention drifts, which is the one bug this format reliably
produces. CID verification stays in `read-frame`, which checks every frame it
parses.

## Public network benchmark

`bin/network_bench.cljs` runs cold end-to-end samples against public
`cid.contact` discovery and Kotobase's advertised HTTP provider. It uses the
original raw CID from the advertisement corpus: IPNI indexes multihashes, so
constructing a DAG-CBOR CID with the same digest would discover the same
provider but name a different object. It also places a bounded timeout or
corrupt response before the real provider to measure failover, and probes that
codec-alias case to ensure it fails closed.

The 2026-08-27 Apple M4 run is recorded in
`bench/results/2026-08-27-public-ipni-provider.edn`: 20/20 normal reads of a
78,054-byte Kotobase block succeeded at p50 538.6 ms / p95 1295.1 ms;
timeout-first fallback was 10/10 at p50 289.3 ms / p95 790.0 ms;
corrupt-first fallback was 10/10 at p50 483.2 ms / p95 1205.0 ms. A DAG-CBOR
CID sharing an advertised raw block's multihash failed closed 5/5, as required:
discovery is multihash-based, while CID verification preserves the codec.
These are one-host public-network observations, not production Arrangement
snapshot or multi-block Datalog latency claims.

### Public persistent Arrangement snapshot

`bin/build_public_snapshot.cljs` deterministically builds the multi-block
fixture without network effects. `bin/public_arrangement_bench.cljs` then
opens its published snapshot cold and makes every block cross the full public
path: cid.contact discovery, the returned Kotobase provider, SHA-256/CID
verification, and the Worker-native Promise cursor. Kotobase's canonical IPLD
route is declared as `/ipld/:cid`; it is not silently confused with the legacy
`/ipfs` namespace.

The Apple M4 run in
`bench/results/2026-08-27-public-arrangement.json` used 24,000 quads in 324
blocks (6,577,346 bytes). A declared `score` range returning 10 rows succeeded
10/10 at p50 866.1 ms / p95 1273.1 ms and verified 7 blocks / 135,577 bytes.
The four-row rare pattern succeeded 10/10 at p50 536.2 ms / p95 772.9 ms and
verified 3 blocks / 17,234 bytes. A full 12,000-row score scan succeeded 3/3 at
p50 2102.8 ms / p95 3996.3 ms and verified 57 blocks / 916,304 bytes. Thus the
persisted range cut reduced this observed full-score read by 8.1x in blocks
and 6.8x in bytes.

These are cold, one-host public-network cursor measurements, not a production
SLA. They predate the Worker-native Datalog `q-async` landing and therefore
measure cursor patterns and range pruning, not multi-clause join latency.

The follow-up live run in
`bench/results/2026-08-27-public-q-async.edn` executes a real four-clause
`q-async`: persisted `score` range 5010–5020 joined by subject to
`kind = common`. It succeeded 10/10 with 10 rows at p50 3356.5 ms / p95
5004.5 ms, verifying 9 blocks / 181,873 bytes per cold sample with 18 memo
hits. This is likewise a one-host public-network observation, not an SLA.

The bounded-parallel follow-up in
`bench/results/2026-08-27-public-q-async-parallel.edn` also succeeded 10/10
with 10 rows. It kept the read at 9 blocks / 181,873 bytes by coalescing 14
in-flight CID reads per sample. Across separate cold runs, p50 was 3666.6 ms
(9.2% slower) and p95 was 4454.4 ms (11.0% faster) than the sequential
observation. Network variation prevents treating that as a universal speedup;
the durable result is bounded fan-out without duplicate verified bytes.

## `ayatori.agent` — the entry an LLM writes through

`bridge` is how a query reaches the datom plane. `agent` is how a query gets
written and refused before it gets there.

```clojure
(require '[ayatori.agent :as agent])

(def schema {:datasets ["market-intel"]
             :attributes [{:attr "company/lei" :doc "LEI, the join key"}
                          {:attr "company/ticker"}]})

(agent/system-prompt schema)          ;; rules + attribute table + examples
(agent/user-turn "list every ticker")
(agent/validate q schema)             ;; nil, or a map to hand back to the model
(agent/repair-turn refusal)           ;; the turn that closed the gap
(agent/extract-query model-output)    ;; nil when there was no query
```

### The dialect is written as a vector; this engine takes only a map

```clojure
(agent/->engine-query '[:find ?t :where [?e "company/ticker" ?t]])
;; => {:find [?t] :where [[?e "company/ticker" ?t]]}
```

Measured 2026-08-18, and the reason both that function and a guard in `bridge/q`
exist:

```
map     {:find [?t] :where [[?e "company/ticker" ?t]]}  =>  #{["AAA"] ["BBB"]}
vector  [:find ?t :where [?e "company/ticker" ?t]]      =>  #{[]}
```

The vector form — what the dialect is written in, what the prompt teaches, what
`validate` approves — is **not refused** by `arrangement.datalog`. `(:find
<vector>)` is nil, so it runs an empty query and answers with one empty tuple,
which no caller can tell from a query that matched nothing. `bridge/q` now
throws on a non-map query instead of passing it through.

**Pure, and depends on nothing** — not even on `bridge`. The caller owns the
model call and the execution. That is what lets `run-tests-pure.cljs` gate it
without the six-repo classpath the rest of the suite needs.

Measured on 2026-08-18 (ADR-2608189300 in `com-junkawasaki/root`), twenty
questions over two real datasets, graded by executing the generated query:
**45.5% bare → 88.9% with schema, examples, `validate` and up to two
`repair-turn`s.** All five bare failures were fabricated attribute names, and
`validate` caught every one without executing anything.

It refuses **shape, not meaning**: fabricated attributes, keyword attributes,
and predicates written as data patterns (`[>= ?r 1e11]`, `[?ni < 0]` — both
came out of that measurement, and both read as semantic errors while being
syntax). It does not know whether a query answers the question.

## The problem this solves

`kotobase.store`/`kotobase.local` (the `IStore` seam every kotobase-backed
app already uses) is a flat get/put/list(keys-in-one-collection)/append
store — no joins, no predicates across collections, no query language.
`kotoba-lang/arrangement` is a 4-covering triple index (`spo`/`pso`/`pos`/
`ocp` ≡ Datomic's EAVT/AEVT/AVET/VAET) with a real Datomic-shaped Datalog
engine (`arrangement.datalog/q`, `:find`/`:where`, joins, negation,
aggregates, recursive rules) over it — but nothing wired `IStore` documents
INTO that index. This repo is that wiring: a thin bridge, not a
reimplementation. `arrangement.datalog` does all the actual query
evaluation; this repo only materializes `IStore` docs as datoms and hands
them to it.

## Memoising it — `materialize-memo` (ADR-2607310900)

The linear scan below is still what `materialize` does. What changed is that a
caller holding a **content address** for the store's state no longer has to pay
for it twice:

```clojure
(def m (bridge/memo))                                   ; caller owns it
(bridge/materialize-memo m store ["users"] chain-cid)   ; version is REQUIRED
(bridge/memo-stats m)                                   ; {:size :capacity :hits :misses}
```

This is a **memo, not a cache**: the key is a content address, so a changed
graph is a *different key* rather than a dirty entry, and there is no
invalidation path to get wrong.

Two properties make sharing one db across callers safe, and both belong to
`materialize` rather than to the memo:

1. **`materialize` takes no `visible?`.** The predicate is applied by `q`, over
   an already-built db — so one db is correct for every caller regardless of
   what any of them may see. There is a test asserting `materialize`'s arity
   never grows, because if it did, this stops being sound.
2. **The db is a value**, so nothing handed out can be mutated into something
   the next caller sees.

**The answer is never memoised** — only the index. A result memo would need
`visible?` in its key, and keying on a function is how one principal ends up
reading another's rows.

`version` is required and must not be nil: a caller with no content address has
nothing that makes a cached db provably current, and defaulting it would
produce a cache that never invalidates. A revision *counter* is not
automatically sufficient either — a counter is unique only along one line of
writes, and a chain can fork.

## ⚠️ Legacy `IStore` limitation: linear materialization

`materialize` does a **full `-list` + `-get` scan of every requested
collection, on every call**, building a throwaway in-memory `arrangement`
db. This is still the compatibility path for flat document stores. There is:

- **no incremental indexing** — every `materialize` call redoes the full scan,
  unless the caller uses the CID-keyed `materialize-memo`/`db-for` seam;
- **no answer caching** — the memo retains a CID-keyed snapshot projection,
  never a principal-specific query result;
- **no persistence** — `arrangement.core/commit!` (the CID-addressed
  snapshot machinery) is never called by this bridge; materialized data
  lives only in memory for the duration of one `materialize`/`q` call.

`ayatori.remote` does not take this path: it reads an already-persistent
arrangement snapshot by CID and follows only the required index ranges.

This is an accepted, explicitly-documented v0.1 scope decision
(ADR-2607172300), not an oversight: fine for the small/test-scale query
volume this bridge is built for right now. Real incremental indexing via
`arrangement`'s own index-maintenance primitives is a natural follow-up
once there is real query-volume evidence — not a v0.1 requirement.

## Doc → datoms mapping

For a document `doc` at `(kotobase.store/-get store coll k)`:

- the **entity** (`:s`) is `(keyword (str coll) (str k))` — e.g. collection
  `"users"` key `"u1"` becomes the entity `:users/u1`. Globally unique
  across every materialized collection.
- every entity always gets two synthetic attributes: **`:kotobase/coll`**
  (`(str coll)`) and **`:kotobase/key`** (`(str k)`) — these carry the
  original collection/key identity through materialization and are the
  join handle a doc in another collection uses to reference this one (see
  the worked example below).
- if `doc` is a map: every top-level `[attr v]` pair becomes a datom
  `{:s entity :p attr :o v}`. `attr` is used **as-is** (whatever key shape
  the document used — typically a keyword). If `v` is itself a non-map
  collection (vector/set/list), it is treated as a **Datomic-style
  cardinality-many attribute**: one datom per element, not one datom whose
  `:o` is the whole collection.
- if `doc` is not a map (a bare scalar, or `nil`): one fallback datom
  `{:s entity :p :kotobase/value :o doc}`.
- **nested maps as attribute values are stored as an opaque `:o` value**,
  not recursively flattened into their own entity — out of scope for v0.1,
  a documented limitation, not silently mishandled.

## API

```clojure
(require '[kotobase.local :as local]
         '[kotobase.store :as st]
         '[ayatori.query :as bridge])

;; materialize: IStore + collection keys -> one combined arrangement db
(bridge/materialize store coll-keys)

;; entity-id: the [coll k] -> entity convention materialize uses
(bridge/entity-id "users" "u1")            ;=> :users/u1

;; access paths: the four covering indexes, each carrying visible?
(bridge/entity-attrs db s visible?)        ; spo / EAVT  -> {p #{o ...}}
(bridge/by-predicate db p visible?)        ; pso / AEVT  -> {s #{o ...}}
(bridge/by-predicate-value db p o visible?); pos / AVET  -> #{s ...}
(bridge/refs-to db o visible?)             ; ocp / VAET  -> {p #{s ...}}
(bridge/datoms db visible?)                ; the whole plane, lazily -> ({:s :p :o} ...)

;; q: run a Datomic-shaped :find/:where query over an already-materialized db
;; visible? is REQUIRED (see below) — arity 3 or arity 4 with :in inputs
(bridge/q db query visible?)
(bridge/q db query visible? inputs)

;; query: one-shot convenience — materialize + q in a single call
(bridge/query store coll-keys query visible?)
(bridge/query store coll-keys query visible? inputs)
```

`visible?` is **required, not defaulted**, on every query fn here — the
same discipline `arrangement.query`/`arrangement.datalog`/the retired `kqe`
already enforce (ADR-2607050500, "Query as first-class effect" in
`com-junkawasaki/root` — no permissive default to silently fall back on).
Pass `(constantly true)` to see everything materialized; that is a
caller's explicit choice, never this bridge's default.

### The supported contract is `materialize` + the access paths, not `q`

**ADR-2608039970** (`com-junkawasaki/root`). Datalog is *one frontend* over
the materialized datom plane, not the IR every other query language has to
be translated into. What the surfaces share is the plane (triple + content
addressing); `q`'s `:find`/`:where` grammar is not part of that.

This is not a prediction — it is already how the surfaces are built.
[`org-w3-sparql-protocol`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/org-w3-sparql-protocol)
uses `materialize` and never calls `q`, and says why in its own README: it
has a complete SPARQL algebra already, so routing SPARQL through Datalog
would translate one algebra into another and back for no benefit. **That
repo is on the supported path, not off it.** The same applies to any surface
whose language does not sit on Datalog's set semantics — SQL's bag semantics
and `ORDER BY`, Cypher's variable-length paths.

| Use | When |
|---|---|
| `materialize` / `materialize-memo` / `db-for` | Always. Every surface goes through the shared plane. |
| `entity-attrs` / `by-predicate` / `by-predicate-value` / `refs-to` | Your language has its own algebra — plan joins over the four indexes yourself. |
| `datoms` | Your engine wants the whole plane once, in its own shape (`org-w3-sparql-protocol` turns every triple into an RDF quad). |
| `q` / `query` | Your language *is* Datalog-shaped (`datomic-client-shim`). |

What a surface must **not** do is give up on the datom plane and keep its
own physical representation of the same documents. Sharing the plane and
sharing the language are different decisions, and ADR-2608039970 makes
opposite calls on them.

**Why re-export rather than point at `arrangement.core`?** Those four exist
there already (they are `datalog.index`'s), but they take no `visible?` —
they are raw index reads. Re-exporting them here is what puts the
ADR-2607050500 discipline on the supported path. Reaching past this
namespace into `arrangement.core/entity-attrs` is not faster, it is a read
with no visibility decision in it. This repo's own tests did exactly that
before ADR-2608039970, which is how it was noticed.

The access paths also **prune**: an attribute whose every value is invisible
is dropped from the returned map rather than returned as an empty set. An
empty set under a key answers *"this exists, but you may see none of it"* —
more than the caller is allowed to know.

**`refs-to` returns `{}` on a typical materialized db, and that is a
property of the data, not a stub.** `:vaet` covers only objects satisfying
`materialize`'s `ref?` (`ipld.core/link?`), and documents carry plain EDN.
A foreign key here is a *value* (`:dept-key "d1"`), so the reverse lookup
you want is `(bridge/by-predicate-value db :dept-key "d1" visible?)`.
Making `ref?` injectable is a real follow-up and not free: `materialize-memo`'s
key would have to cover it, and a function is not a memo key — a declarative
`:ref-attrs #{...}` set would be.

### Worked example (equality filter + cross-collection join)

```clojure
(def store (local/local-store))
(st/-put store "users" "u1" {:name "Alice" :role "admin" :dept-key "d1"})
(st/-put store "users" "u2" {:name "Bob" :role "user" :dept-key "d2"})
(st/-put store "departments" "d1" {:name "Engineering"})
(st/-put store "departments" "d2" {:name "Sales"})

(bridge/query store ["users" "departments"]
              '{:find [?uname ?dname]
                :where [[?u :role "admin"]
                        [?u :name ?uname]
                        [?u :dept-key ?dk]
                        [?d :kotobase/key ?dk]
                        [?d :name ?dname]]}
              (constantly true))
;=> #{["Alice" "Engineering"]}
```

`?u`'s `:dept-key` value ("d1") joins against `?d`'s `:kotobase/key`
attribute — a real cross-collection join, evaluated by
`arrangement.datalog`'s nested-loop join, not reimplemented here.

## A note on `kqe`

ADR-2607172300's dependency table names `kotoba-lang/kqe` alongside
`kotoba-lang/arrangement`. As of this repo's landing, **`kqe` is retired
upstream** — its content (`[s p o]` pattern routing) was merged into
`arrangement` as `arrangement.query`, and the Datomic-shaped `:find`/`:where`
Datalog engine used here (`arrangement.datalog/q`) lives in `arrangement`
and never existed in `kqe` at all. This repo therefore depends on
`kotoba-lang/arrangement` only — see `kqe`'s README ("this repo is
retired") and `arrangement`'s own README / ADR-2607050700 for the merge.

## Dependencies

- [`kotoba-lang/kotobase`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase) —
  `kotobase.store`/`kotobase.local` (`IStore`, `LocalStore`), the seam this
  bridge reads from.
- [`kotoba-lang/arrangement`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/arrangement) —
  the persistent 4-covering index, prefix/range cursor, and Datalog engine.
  `ayatori.remote` reads its CID-addressed snapshots directly.
- [`kotoba-lang/io-ipld`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/io-ipld) —
  CID verification for every block returned by a provider. It pulls in
  `org-ietf-cbor` and `dev-protobuf`.
- [`kotoba-lang/io-multiformats`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/io-multiformats) —
  strict parsing of advertised HTTP-gateway multiaddrs. `deps.edn`'s direct
  git dependencies resolve the complete chain automatically for
  the JVM `:test` alias via `tools.deps`; the nbb primary test path has no
  dependency resolver, so `bin/run_tests.cljs`/CI clone every transitive
  dep by hand — see Develop/test below.
- [`kotoba-lang/io-ipni-specs`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/io-ipni-specs) —
  provider discovery through Delegated Routing V1 and IPNI-native `/cid`.
  Transport and JSON parsing are caller-injected; discovery never rewrites
  the content CID and does not imply successful IPLD retrieval.
## Develop / test

First-class runtime is **nbb/cljs** (repo-wide runtime priority):

```bash
for repo in kotobase security arrangement prolly-tree io-ipld io-ipld-car \
            io-multiformats org-ietf-cbor dev-protobuf datom-source datalog \
            block-cache io-ipni-specs org-nist-sha2 envelope org-signal; do
  git clone "https://github.com/kotoba-lang/$repo" ".deps/$repo"
done
npm install
nbb --classpath "$(cat bin/classpath.txt)" bin/run_tests.cljs
```

The classpath is in `bin/classpath.txt` so there is one of it. Check each
`.deps/<name>` out at its pinned SHA: the direct ones are in `deps.edn`
(`kotobase`, `arrangement`, `io-ipld`, `io-ipld-car`, `io-multiformats`,
`io-ipni-specs`, `envelope`) and the rest are named by the `deps.edn` of the
repo that depends on them — `kotobase` → `security`; `arrangement` →
`prolly-tree`, `io-ipld`, `datom-source`, `datalog`, `block-cache`; `io-ipld`
→ `io-multiformats`, `org-ietf-cbor`, `dev-protobuf`; `io-multiformats` →
`org-nist-sha2` (required as `sha2.core`, and its absence made every
documented reproduction of this suite die before the first test until
2026-09-04); `envelope` → `org-signal`.

⚠ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` holds a second hand-copied set of those SHAs and
says it is kept in lockstep with `deps.edn`. Measured 2026-09-06 it is not,
and one of the skews — `io-multiformats` at `b3b157e6` instead of `561fe7df`
— stops the suite before a single test runs. The file is inert (Actions are
disabled fleet-wide and are not the CI authority, ADR-2607300900), so it is
left alone rather than kept up; read the pins from `deps.edn`.

Measured 2026-09-06 on nbb 1.5.212 / Node 26.7.0: **131 tests, 399
assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors**, including real AES-GCM content through a
verified remote cursor and a real hybrid-KEM-wrapped content key delivered
through `ayatori.disclosure-open`.

The `:test` alias in `deps.edn` is the JVM **compat** suite only (`clojure
-M:test`, via `tools.deps` transitive git-dep resolution — no manual
`.deps/` cloning needed for this path) — not the primary execution path.
