  "The suite under ClojureScript, for the murakumo fleet's cross-runtime gate.

  Ayatori bridges query surfaces onto the datom plane inside the Worker.
  Measured 2026-08-17 on datom-source: a portable suite can be green on the
  JVM and red under nbb for reasons production does not have (SCI deftype
  behaviour), so the `.cljc` extension alone is not grounds for a second
  gate -- a matching measurement is.

      npx nbb --classpath src:test:<deps> run-tests.cljs

  ## What changed here, and why (2026-09-04)

  This file used to name four namespaces in `:require` and then call
  `t/run-all-tests` with a namespace PATTERN, on the reasoning -- correct as
  far as it went -- that \"a runner that repeats the list can fall behind the
  suite and report a subset as a pass\".

  The pattern did not fix that. It filters namespaces that are LOADED, and
  what gets loaded is decided by the `:require` list it was meant to
  replace. Its regex matched `ayatori.remote-test`; the require list omitted
  it; so this entry -- the one the fleet gate runs, the one whose docstring
  called it the whole suite -- silently skipped the ONE namespace covering
  discovery -> fetch -> CID verification and reported 66 tests as a pass,
  while the repo's `:jvm-test` gate saw all 77 and also reported a pass.
  Two green gates, two different suites, no way to tell from either output.

  `ayatori.suite` now derives the set from the files on disk, so there is no
  list here to fall behind."
