  "IPNI provider discovery for Ayatori.

  Discovery answers *where a CID may be fetched*. It does not fetch IPLD
  blocks, verify their CIDs, traverse a graph, or evaluate a query. Keeping
  those effects separate prevents an indexer response from being mistaken
  for content or query evidence. HTTP transport and JSON parsing are injected
  by the caller through `ipni.find`."
