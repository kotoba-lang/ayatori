(ns ayatori.remote
  "Verified, range-pruned queries over a remote persistent arrangement.

  This namespace is the wiring between Ayatori's three existing planes:

  1. `discover-fn` resolves a block CID to IPNI provider records;
  2. `fetch-fn` asks those providers for the IPLD block bytes;
  3. every returned block is rehashed against the requested CID;
  4. `arrangement.source/cursor` follows only the persisted index ranges a
     query names; and
  5. `ayatori.query/q` evaluates Datalog directly over that cursor.

  Discovery is not retrieval, and retrieval is not verification.  The
  separate injected functions keep those effects visible and make provider
  fallback testable without a network.  A verified block is memoised by CID
  for the lifetime of an opened snapshot; unverified bytes are never cached.

  The persistent index is produced by `arrangement.core/commit!` (or its
  incremental variants).  Ayatori reads that IPLD snapshot; it does not copy
  it into a throwaway in-memory database."

     Discovery and provider retrieval may reject or return Promises. Providers
     are tried in discovery order; only bytes whose SHA-256 multihash matches
     the requested CID are memoised. The memo stores resolved verified bytes,
     never a rejected Promise or an unverified response.

     `:block-source` is optional: `(fn [cid] -> bytes-or-nil-or-Promise)`,
     tried BEFORE discovery and awaited if it returns a Promise. Its bytes are
     verified on the same path as a provider's -- being local is not being
     trusted. A source that answers with the wrong bytes, rejects, or throws
     is SKIPPED the way a mismatching provider is, and counted as
     :source-failures so a corrupt pack is visible rather than merely slow.

     A source that resolves NIL is skipped and NOT counted: it has not failed
     at anything, it simply does not carry that block. Counting a miss makes
     a pack that legitimately holds half the blocks read exactly like a
     corrupt one, which is the distinction :source-failures exists to draw.
     This matches `provider-block-getter`, whose miss is likewise uncounted.

     Whatever the source does, a miss costs exactly ONE discovery -- the same
     as passing no source at all. The two stages below are ordered so that a
     fall-through which itself fails cannot re-enter the source's error
     handler and buy a second one.
