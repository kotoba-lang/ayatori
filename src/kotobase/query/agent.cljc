(ns kotobase.query.agent
  "Helping a caller — in practice a language model — write a query for this
  bridge, and refusing the bad ones before they reach the plane.

  ## Why this is here rather than in each caller

  ADR-2608189300 (`com-junkawasaki/root`) chose the kotobase dialect
  (Datomic-shaped EDN Datalog) as the agent-facing query surface. Part of that
  argument was measured on 2026-08-18 against two real datasets with
  `murakumo-main` (then qwen3.8-27b), twenty questions, graded by executing the
  generated query and comparing result sets:

      bare (dialect name and notation rules only)      5 / 11  = 45.5%
      schema + few-shot + validate + repair (<= 2)    16 / 18  = 88.9%

  Every one of the five bare failures was a fabricated attribute —
  `company/revenue` for `company/revenue-usd`, `company/isic-code` for
  `company/isic`, `market-intel/lei`, `repo-taxonomy/jurisdiction` — and
  `validate` caught all five **without executing anything**. That is the
  security property the dialect was chosen for, and it only holds if the same
  check runs everywhere. Two copies of it is one copy that gets fixed.

  ## Pure by construction

  No I/O, no dependencies — not even on `kotobase.query.bridge`. The caller
  owns the model call and the execution; this namespace only turns a schema
  into a prompt and a query into either `nil` or a structured refusal. That is
  what makes it cheap to test, and what lets the benchmark and production run
  the same code instead of two that drift.

  ## Schema shape

      {:datasets   [\"market-intel\" \"repo-taxonomy\"]
       :attributes [{:attr \"company/lei\" :doc \"LEI, the join key\"} ...]}

  There is deliberately no `:type` on an attribute. Types were considered on
  2026-08-18 and rejected for now: the two failures that survived the repair
  loop looked semantic but were not — `[>= ?r 100000000000]` and `[?ni < 0]`
  are both a **predicate written as a data pattern**, which is syntax. A type
  system would have caught neither. Add types when a failure needs them."
