;; bench/caches_and_writes.cljs — Co-Scientist iteration 05. The three seeds
;; iteration 04 left.
;;
;;   D  Hold the pack OPENS as well as the catalog. Iteration 04 predicted this
;;      makes packed cost `N` and beat per-object's `2N` on every workload, and
;;      called that "a large claim, so it needs the measurement and not the
;;      arithmetic". The arithmetic is also UNFAIR, and section D is mostly about
;;      that: per-object's `2N` is discover + fetch, and DISCOVERY IS CACHEABLE
;;      TOO. Warming one arm and not the other measures the harness.
;;   E  A real width-1 dependency chain instead of a list of CIDs known upfront.
;;      The commit chain is one: commit N's block names commit N-1, and you
;;      cannot ask for N-1 until you have decoded N.
;;   F  The write side, which nothing has measured at all.
;;
;; Round trips, never wall clock.
