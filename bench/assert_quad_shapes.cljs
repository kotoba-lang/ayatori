;; bench/assert_quad_shapes.cljs — Co-Scientist iteration 10.
;;
;; A fold on yoro-social-v2 spends ~27 CPU-seconds between its last store call
;; and being killed, never reaching qs/commit! (root ADR-2609100100: the phase
;; probe reports gets:135 decrypts:1665 encrypts:0 blinds:0 at ms:5512, then
;; dies at 32500ms). The only thing fold!'s cljs branch runs in that window is
;; the reduce that applies novelty quads into the hydrated db, so apply-quad
;; was the obvious suspect.
;;
;; It is not. This eliminates it, twice: by db size, and by value shape --
;; because ADR-2609051700's lesson is that the constant lives in the codec, so
;; a sweep that only varies COUNT can miss it.
;;
;; Run:
;;   nbb --classpath "src:$(clojure -Spath)" bench/assert_quad_shapes.cljs

(ns aq2 (:require [arrangement.core :as arr] [ipld.core :as ipld]))
;; The previous sweep used trivial string values and found assert-quad flat at
;; ~0.01ms. The fold's real rows are not that: kotobase stores EDN-encoded
;; values and IPLD Links, and `ref?` is `ipld/link?`, which routes Link values
;; into a fourth index. ADR-2609051700's lesson is that the constant lives in
;; the codec, not the caller -- so vary the VALUE, not the count.
