;; bench/commit_packs.cljs — Co-Scientist iteration 03: the write policy itself.
;;
;; Iteration 02 measured the many-pack regime by SPLITTING one snapshot into P
;; packs. That answers "what does a query pay when blocks are spread over P
;; packs", and it is not the shape ADR-2608160100 proposes. The proposal is
;; ONE COMMIT, ONE PACK, and a commit is not a shard: it writes only NOVELTY,
;; and a prolly tree shares every subtree it did not change. So the blocks a
;; query touches at commit N were written across commits 1..N, in whatever
;; proportion the tree's sharing produced -- not in equal slices.
;;
;; This builds real successive commits (`arr/commit!` with `prev`), packs each
;; commit's newly-written blocks, and asks the same query of the head.
;;
;; ## Two things iteration 02 left unpriced, and this one prices
;;
;; 1. The CATALOG. Both earlier benches used an in-memory map for CID -> pack,
;;    which a deployment does not have: ADR-2608160100 puts the pack catalog on
;;    the datom plane, so the FIRST lookup of a pack is a request. `--catalog`
;;    counts it. Reporting the optimistic figure alone would be reporting a
;;    deployment nobody can build.
;; 2. Whether a commit is big enough to be worth a pack at all. Iteration 02's
;;    rule is `blocks-read / packs-opened > 2`; this measures what that ratio
;;    actually is when the packs are commits.
;;
;; Round trips, never wall clock. Both arms answer the same query over the same
;; head and the harness exits 2 if they disagree.
