;; bench/inference_channel.cljs — what a caller learns about data it cannot
;; read one value of.
;;
;; ADR-2609108000 (com-junkawasaki/root) says: measure the channel before
;; adding a defence. This is that measurement, and it exists because
;; `default-max-datoms` is a RESOURCE bound, not a privacy bound -- the two
;; were being read as one thing.
;;
;; The shape under test is structural, not a mistake:
;;
;;   materialize : [store coll-keys]  |  [store coll-keys max-datoms]
;;                  ^ no visible? in either arity
;;
;; `visible?` is applied by `q` OVER the materialized plane. That is safe for
;; VALUES -- the ns docstring is right, and section C proves it. It is not a
;; statement about CARDINALITY, and the ceiling that bounds the scan reports
;; the cardinality it refused at, in `ex-data`, before any visibility
;; decision has been made.
;;
;; Every section states what it would take to make it fail, and the run
;; returns a COUNT of failures (a boolean cannot tell one regression from a
;; broken build).
;;
;; Run:
;;   nbb --classpath "$(cat /path/to/cp.txt)" bench/inference_channel.cljs
