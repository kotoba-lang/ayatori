(ns kotobase.query.agent-engine-test
  "`kotobase.query.agent` refuses shapes; `arrangement.datalog` is what actually
  runs them. Those are two implementations of one grammar and nothing compared
  them until 2026-08-18.

  The comparison that existed before this namespace ran against DataScript, in
  `com-junkawasaki/root`'s `grammar-agreement.cljs`, because that is the engine
  the benchmark plane uses. It is NOT the engine kotobase queries through, and
  the first thing checking here found was not a disagreement about a shape but
  a disagreement about the *form*:

      map     {:find [?t] :where [[?e \"company/ticker\" ?t]]}  => #{[\"AAA\"] [\"BBB\"]}
      vector  [:find ?t :where [?e \"company/ticker\" ?t]]      => #{[]}

  The vector form -- what the dialect is written in, what the prompt teaches,
  what `validate` approves -- is not rejected by this engine. `(:find <vector>)`
  is nil, so it runs an empty query and answers with one empty tuple, which no
  caller can tell from a query that matched nothing."
