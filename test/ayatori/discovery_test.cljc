  "Discovery is not retrieval.

  `ayatori.discovery` had no tests until 2026-09-04, while being half of
  what this repo is named for. What is checked here is what this namespace
  PROMISES in its own docstrings and what nothing else covers:

    - the content CID is never rewritten, whatever a router answers;
    - a router that fails transport is one failed response, not a failed
      lookup -- and in the async path, not a rejected aggregate Promise;
    - 404 and an empty provider list are answers, not errors;
    - quorum counts routers that ANSWERED, so one dead router out of two
      still meets quorum 1 and fails quorum 2.

  The transport is injected, so none of this touches a network."
