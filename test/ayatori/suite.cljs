  ## Why this exists

  Measured 2026-09-04, this repo had FOUR nbb entry points and each reported
  a different green, all `0 failures`:

      bin/run_tests.cljs    53 tests / 106 assertions   (GitHub CI)
      run-tests.cljs        66 / 137                    (fleet gate, self-described
                                                         as \"the whole suite\")
      run-tests-pure.cljs   18 /  47                    (dependency-free half)
      all five namespaces   77 / 165                    (nothing ran this)

  None of them ran the whole suite, and the two fleet gates disagreed with
  each other: `:jvm-test` discovers namespaces through cognitect's runner
  and saw all five, while `nbb-cross-runtime-query` ran `run-tests.cljs` and
  saw four -- missing `ayatori.remote-test`, the ONE namespace that
  exercises discovery -> fetch -> CID verification, which is the thing this
  repo is for.

  `run-tests.cljs` had already diagnosed the failure mode in a comment --
  \"a runner that repeats the list can fall behind the suite and report a
  subset as a pass\" -- and replaced its list with a `t/run-all-tests`
  namespace PATTERN. That does not fix it, for a reason the comment does
  not reach: the pattern filters namespaces that are LOADED, and what gets
  loaded is decided by the `:require` list the pattern was meant to
  replace. Its regex matches `ayatori.remote-test`. The require list omits
  it. So the guard against falling behind was itself downstream of the
  thing it was guarding.

  ## What this does instead

  Enumerate `test/**/*_test.clj[cs]` on disk, let the entry `require` that
  set at its top level, and run exactly it. There is no list to fall behind,
  because there is no list.

  The require has to happen at the ENTRY's top level: nbb awaits top-level
  loads and does not await one issued from inside a function, so requiring
  from within `run!` loads nothing and `t/run-tests` throws
  `No namespace: ... found`. Loud, but for the wrong reason.

  Three floors, because a runner that cannot see the suite must not return
  the same value as a runner that saw it and found nothing wrong:

    - zero test namespaces found  -> exit 2 (wrong directory / bad classpath)
    - zero assertions executed    -> exit 2 (namespaces loaded but empty)
    - a file declares more `deftest` forms than its namespace registers
                                  -> exit 2 (forms swallowed by a paren)

  The third was earned in kotoba-lang/envelope on 2026-09-06: seven of a new
  test file's twelve `deftest` forms were swallowed into a preceding form by
  one unbalanced paren. The file parsed, the namespace loaded, the runner ran
  the five that survived and printed `0 failures`. Deriving the namespace
  list from disk does not catch that -- the file IS on disk and the namespace
  IS loaded, and what went missing is inside it. Counting `(deftest` at the
  start of a line and comparing with the registered vars does. It over-counts
  only if a top-level string contains such a line, which refuses rather than
  passes.

  Exit 2 is neither 0 nor 1: \"could not answer\" is not a pass and not a
  failure."
