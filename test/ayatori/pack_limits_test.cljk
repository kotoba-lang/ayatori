  "What `open-pack` does with a pack whose header or index it cannot honour.

  Two gaps, both of the shape where not measuring looks like measuring.

  The index was fetched as `bytes=N-` -- the rest of the object, whatever
  that was. The reader learns the size by holding it, so a large tail, or a
  store that ignores Range, is an unbounded read that nothing downstream can
  undo. Requesting a bounded range makes the ceiling the reader's choice.

  The characteristics bitfield was parsed and dropped. CARv2 gives an archive
  128 bits to say it is not an ordinary one; read and discarded, saying so and
  saying nothing produced the same read."
